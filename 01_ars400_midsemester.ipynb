    "A look at the top words used and the sentiments expressed in Trump tweets indicates that, some words are used with others almost all the time. A notable example is the slogan like Make America Great Again. As such, it may be beneficial to look at groups of words rather than individual words. For that, we will look at an approach applying a Principal Component Analysis. \n",

    "### The PCA\n",
    "The Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a tool generally used to identify patterns and to reduce the number of variables you have to consider in your analysis. For example, if you have data with 200 columns, it may be that a significant amount of the variance in your data can be explained by just 100 principal components. In the PCA, the first component is chosen in such a way that has the largest variance, subsequent components are orthogonal and continue covering as much variance as possible. In this way, the PCA samples as much of the variability in the data set with the first few components. Mathematically, each component is a linear combination of all the input parameters times coefficients specific for that component. These coefficients, or loading factors, are constrained such that the sum of the squares of them are equal to 1. As such, the loading factors serve as weights describing how strongly certain parameters contribute to the specific principal component. Parameters with large values of positive or negative loading factors are correlated with each other, which can serve to identify trends in your data."
